There's 2 *apps* but each one works alone.

###OpenFrontWorkflow-App.app
**Description**: When launched, asks for the location of the project you want to launch. When browsed, opens the necessary path to get ready to work:

- **Terminal.app**: opens the shell right in the project
- **Sublime Text**: opens the entire folder within this app
- **Finder**: opens the project folder

**Use**: Download and drag it to the Applications folder. If you want, drag it to the dock.
